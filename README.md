# RaceTrackGame
This is my first full game in Unity. First, the player enters the menu, where he presses start and the game begins. There are 8 gates (checkpoints), upon passing which the red light changes to green and the number of checkpoints passed is recorded in the upper left corner. There are 3 laps until the end of the game. After finishing the race, the player sees the total time and the best time. Then the player can either restart the game by clicking on the appropriate button or go back to the menu. There are still a few bugs in the game that I continue to work on to make the game more attractive and professional.
